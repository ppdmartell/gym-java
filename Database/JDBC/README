Assistant, in these days, is the JDBC used directly by developers? Or has the JDBC turned into a
low-level layer used by frameworks and developers use these frameworks instead of the JDBC?

As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the use of JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
directly by developers is still quite common, especially in projects where developers need
fine-grained control over database operations and performance. JDBC provides a straightforward
and standard way to interact with databases in Java applications, making it a popular choice 
for many developers.

However, it's worth noting that the Java ecosystem has evolved significantly over the years, and
many higher-level frameworks and libraries have emerged that build upon JDBC to provide more
abstracted and convenient database access. These frameworks aim to simplify database operations
and reduce boilerplate code, making development faster and more efficient.

Some popular Java frameworks that utilize JDBC or provide abstractions over it include:

1. **Spring Framework**: Spring offers the Spring JDBC module, which provides a higher-level
abstraction for database operations. It simplifies JDBC usage by handling tasks like connection
management, exception handling, and resource cleanup, allowing developers to focus more on business
logic.

2. **Hibernate**: Hibernate is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that allows developers
to map Java objects to database tables. It abstracts away SQL and JDBC details, making database
interactions more object-oriented and developer-friendly.

3. **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: JPA is a Java specification for ORM, and it is commonly used in
combination with implementations like Hibernate. It provides a standard API for interacting with
relational databases using object-oriented approaches.

4. **MyBatis**: MyBatis is a SQL mapping framework that allows developers to write SQL statements
and map the results to Java objects. It provides more control over the SQL queries while still
abstracting away some JDBC details.

The availability of these higher-level frameworks has reduced the need for developers to write raw
JDBC code directly in many cases. Instead, developers can leverage the features and abstractions
offered by these frameworks to work with databases more efficiently.

Ultimately, the choice of whether to use raw JDBC or one of these higher-level frameworks depends
on the specific requirements of the project and the developer's preference. Some projects may
still benefit from using raw JDBC for precise control, while others may find higher-level
frameworks more convenient for rapid development. As the Java ecosystem continues to evolve,
new technologies and patterns may also influence the database access strategies used by developers.
