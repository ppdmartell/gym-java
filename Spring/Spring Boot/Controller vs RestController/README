/*
In [1] you could find the differences between @Controller and @RestController.
INFO: One thing that impressed me is that you can also return a JSON document (see code below) by using a
@Controller class. I thought this was only possible with @RestController, since @Controller is
usually used to return a view with Thymeleaf.

@Controller
@RequestMapping("books")
public class SimpleBookController {

    @GetMapping("/{id}", produces = "application/json")
    public @ResponseBody Book getBook(@PathVariable int id) {
        return findBookById(id);
    }

}
