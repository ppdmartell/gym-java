Ideas for simple arrays[], ArraysList and LinkedList. Go through the resources and write conceptually how those three work.
Get the material from gpt about contiguous blocks for arrays[] and how the retrieving time is constant (sum from the initial block
to the desired one). Write about the underlying array for ArrayList and why it's a problem when you have inserting/deleting
operations in the middle of the ArrayList.

* There is an interesting entry about contiguous blocks for arrays[] and how they are abstracted away from the programmer
by the JVM, opposite as what assembly language does (EAX).
