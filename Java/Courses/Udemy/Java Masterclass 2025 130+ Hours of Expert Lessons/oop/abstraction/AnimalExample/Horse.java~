// Interesting, method move(String speed) was overriden in Mammal (super Animal), so due to this,
// I am not forced to override it in concrete Horse class. Only need to override makeNoise(), the
// other abstract method from Animal that was not overriden in Mammal.
// Method shedHair() is abstract in Mammal, so I must override it here in Horse concrete class.
