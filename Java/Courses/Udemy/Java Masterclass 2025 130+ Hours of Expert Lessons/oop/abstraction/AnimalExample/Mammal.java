// An abstract class than extends another abstract class doesn't have to implement abstract methods
//  - It can implement all of the parent's abstract methods.
//  - It can implement some of them.
//  - It can implement none of them.
//  - It can also include additional abstract methods, which will force subclasses to implement both
//  Animal's abstract methods as well as Mammal's.
