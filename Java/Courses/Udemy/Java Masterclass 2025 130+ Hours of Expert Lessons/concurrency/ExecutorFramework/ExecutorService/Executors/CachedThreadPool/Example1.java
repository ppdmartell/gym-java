/*
 * What is Executors.newCachedThreadPool()?

 * It's a thread pool that:

 * Creates new threads as needed

 * Reuses idle threads that were previously created (for up to 60 seconds)

 * Great for lots of short-lived asynchronous tasks
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * You donâ€™t tell the pool how many threads to create.

 * It creates as many threads as needed for the tasks you submit.

 * If it already has idle threads, it will reuse them instead of creating new ones.
 * */
