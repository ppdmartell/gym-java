Assistant, if submit() allows Runnable (returns nothing, fire and don't worry) and Callable that returns
 something, then what's the purpose of having Runnable if the execute() method is already fire and don't worry?


## Java Concurrency: `execute()` vs `submit()`

This is a great question â€” you're connecting the dots like a real Java craftsman. Let's break it down clearly.

---

### ðŸ”¥ `execute(Runnable)` vs `submit(Runnable)`

```
+---------------------+----------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Feature             | execute(Runnable)          | submit(Runnable)                        |
+---------------------+----------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Input               | Runnable                   | Runnable or Callable<V>                 |
| Return type         | void                       | Future<?>                               |
| Behavior            | Fire-and-forget            | Fire-and-track (even with Runnable)     |
| Exception handling  | Silently lost              | Captured in Future.get() as exception   |
| Can cancel it?      | No                         | Yes, via Future.cancel()                |
| Can wait for it?    | No                         | Yes, via Future.get() (returns null)    |
+---------------------+----------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
```

### ðŸ§  So why use `submit(Runnable)` if it returns `null`?

Because `submit(Runnable)` gives you a `Future<?>`, which comes with **powerful benefits**:

---

### âœ… 1. Track task completion

Even though the `Runnable` doesn't return a result, you can **wait for the task to finish**:

```java
Future<?> f = executor.submit(() -> doStuff());
f.get(); // Blocks until task completes
```

---

### âœ… 2. Handle exceptions properly

With `execute()`, if the `Runnable` throws an exception, it's often just swallowed by the thread.
With `submit()`, exceptions are captured and surfaced through the `Future`:

```java
Future<?> f = executor.submit(() -> {
    throw new RuntimeException("Oops!");
});
try {
    f.get(); // Will throw ExecutionException
} catch (ExecutionException e) {
    System.out.println("Caught: " + e.getCause());
}
```

---

### âœ… 3. Cancel a running task

You can cancel it if you no longer need the task:

```java
Future<?> f = executor.submit(() -> {
    while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
        // long-running task
    }
});
f.cancel(true); // Interrupts the thread if possible
```

---

### âœ… 4. Integration & Tracking

You can store all your `Future<?>` results in a list and:

* Wait for all to complete
* Time out selectively
* Cancel tasks conditionally

---

### âœ… Summary: When to use what?

```
+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| Use execute(Runnable) when:           | Use submit(Runnable) when:                   |
+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| You truly donâ€™t care about results     | You want to check success/failure            |
| You donâ€™t need task tracking           | You want to cancel, wait, or catch exceptions|
| Simple fire-and-forget logic           | Youâ€™re building a batch/task system          |
+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Rule of Thumb:

> âœ… If you want **no feedback**, use `execute()`
> âœ… If you want **control**, even for a `Runnable`, use `submit()`
