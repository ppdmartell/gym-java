According to gpt[1], optimistic locking is:

Optimistic lock is a concurrency control technique used in multi-threaded applications to manage
access to shared resources in a way that minimizes the possibility of contention and allows for
better performance in scenarios where conflicts are infrequent.

In optimistic locking, instead of acquiring and holding locks on shared resources while performing
operations, the thread first reads the resource's state and remembers it (usually in a version
number or timestamp). Then, the thread performs its operation on the local copy of the resource
without holding any locks. When the thread is ready to update the shared resource, it checks if
the resource's state (e.g., version number) is still the same as when it was read. If the state
has not changed (i.e., no other thread modified the resource in the meantime), the thread updates
the resource and commits the changes. However, if the state has changed (i.e., another thread has
modified the resource), the thread can decide to retry the operation, apply conflict resolution
strategies, or take other appropriate actions.

The main advantage of optimistic locking is that it reduces the need for thread synchronization
and locking, which can improve concurrency and reduce contention. It allows multiple threads to
read and operate on shared resources concurrently without blocking each other, and conflicts are
resolved later when updating the resource.

Optimistic locking is commonly used in scenarios where conflicts are relatively rare, and it can
provide better scalability and performance compared to traditional locking mechanisms like
pessimistic locking, where threads acquire and hold locks throughout the entire operation.

Optimistic locking is often used in database systems, distributed systems, and concurrent
programming frameworks where the overhead of acquiring and releasing locks for every operation
can be significant. However, it requires careful implementation to handle conflicts and ensure
data consistency, as well as proper conflict resolution strategies to handle scenarios where
conflicts do occur.
